# Getting Started with IoTivity (Device Simulation)

## Introduction

This guide will show you how to download, build, and run two simulated devices on the same Linux PC:

- The *server*, a command-line app, simulates a smart home device such as a smart switch.
- The *client*, a GUI app, controls the smart device. The client typically runs on a smart phone.

The two apps talk to each other over a loopback connection, using the OCF protocol.

**To use Windows:** To download, build, and run on a Windows PC instead, check the Iotivity [FAQ](https://wiki.iotivity.org/getting_started_troubleshooting_and_faq).

## Requirements

To carry out this tutorial, you will need the following:

- A Debian-based Linux PC (e.g., Ubuntu), with an internet connection.

## Install and Run the Server App

1. On the development PC, open a terminal.

2. Download source and set up the IoTivity-Lite environment by running this command, which takes several minutes to complete:

   ```
   curl https://openconnectivity.github.io/IOTivity-Lite-setup/install.sh | bash
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the install.sh script, review and run it from any location.

3. Generate code for the server app by running these commands:

   ```
   cd ~/iot-lite/
   ./gen.sh
   ```

   This script runs the DeviceBuilder app with a default JSON configuration file that can be edited to specify the capabilities of your actual device.

4. Build and run the server app by running these commands:

   ```
   ./build.sh
   ./reset.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

Leave this terminal window open. The server app is now waiting for commands from the client app, which you’ll install next.

## Build and Run the Client App

The sample client application is called OTGC (Onboarding Tool and Generic Client). Build the Linux version by executing the script as described below:

1. On the development PC, open another terminal window.

2. Download and build the Linux OTGC client by running this command, which takes several minutes to complete:

   ```
   curl https://openconnectivity.github.io/otgc-linux/setup.sh | bash
   ```

   **Troubleshooting:** If the build process completes, but an error occurs, manually run the dpkg command from the setup.sh script.

   ```
   sudo dpkg -i ./otgc-linux/build/debian/out/otgc-2.9.0.deb
   #run only in the event of an error and substitute the version of otgc
   #that is available at this location (for example, the version number will
   #increment as new versions are created (e.g. otgc-2.10.0.deb))
   ```

3. Launch the Linux OTGC client by running this command:

   ```
   /usr/bin/otgc.sh
   ```

   ![/usr/bin/otgc.sh](/Images/usr-bin-otgc.sh.png)

4. Click to OK the End User License Agreement.

   ![client application loads](/Images/client-application-loads.png)

   OTGC starts and automatically scans all visible OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation) devices, listing them in the app's left-hand pane. In the screen above, the device found is called server_lite_3173.

5. Locate and align both the terminal window that is awaiting incoming connections, plus the app window, so that both are visible.

   As you proceed with the remaining steps in this section, notice that each action taken in the client app generates console output in the terminal window that had been awaiting incoming connections. This proves that you are controlling your smart home device:

   - Click to select the device listed in the left-hand pane, and click the Onboard button.

     ![select device and onboard](/Images/onboard-button.png)

     The Select OTM (Ownership Transfer Method) dialog box pops up.

   - OK the Select OTM dialog box.

     ![select PKI for the most rigorous security OTM](/Images/set-device-name.png)

     As device ownership is transferred, the Select OTM dialog box closes and is replaced by the Set Device Name dialog box.

   - Change the device name, if you wish. Click OK to close the dialog box.

     In this example, the device name will be changed to server_lite_####.
     The bar to the left of the device will turn green indicating that the device is now owned by your copy of OTGC.

   - Click to reselect the device in the left-hand pane. In the Generic Client tab, toggle the Value switch on and off. You should see the monitor window for the server device indicating true and false as you change the state of the switch.

     ![toggle value switch](/Images/toggle-switch.png)

8. Click the offboard button to relinquish your ownership and return the security state to Ready For Onboarding Transfer Method (RFOTM)

9. Quit the client app and then press Ctrl-C in the server terminal to stop the server device.

## Customize the Code

IoTivity provides a tool for automatically generating server code as a significant head start for your software development. The code generation tool works from a JSON file created by you that describes the capabilities of your device. The server code you compiled and ran in this tutorial began from example.json file, found in the ~/iot-lite/ directory on your development PC.

The steps below will show you how to make a simple change to the JSON file, recompile, and run the server and client. You can then see how the changes you made to the server’s capabilities in the JSON file are reflected in the client app.

1. On your development PC, back up the example.json file:

   ```
   cd ~/iot-lite/
   cp example.json example.json.bak
   ```

2. Open the example.json file in your preferred editor. This can be easily done with the ./edit_input.sh script or you can open the example.json file with your favorite text editor.

3. Add a dimming resource. The example.json file will now have two resources: binary switch and dimming.  

   ```
[
  {
    "path" : "/binaryswitch",
    "rt"   : [ "oic.r.switch.binary" ],
    "if"   : ["oic.if.baseline", "oic.if.a" ],
    "remove_properties" : [ "range", "step" , "id", "precision" ]
  },
  {
    "path" : "/dimming",
    "rt"   : [ "oic.r.light.dimming" ],
    "if"   : ["oic.if.baseline", "oic.if.a" ],
    "remove_properties" : [ "range", "step", "value" , "id" , "precision" ]
  },
  {
    "path" : "/oic/p",
    "rt"   : [ "oic.wk.p" ],
    "if"   : ["oic.if.baseline", "oic.if.r" ],
    "remove_properties" : [ "n", "range", "value", "step", "precision", "vid"  ]
  }
]
   ```


   Save your changes.

4. While still in the ~/iot-lite/ directory, generate the server code, build, and run:

   ```
   ./gen.sh
   ./build.sh
   ./reset.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

5. Run the client app:

   ```
   /usr/bin/otgc.sh
   ```

6. As you observed in Step 5 of the **Install and Run the Client App** section above, notice how the console output in the server terminal responds to actions taken in the client app:

   * Click to select the device and click the Onboard button.
   * Select PKI and OK in OTM dialog box.
   * Change the device name, if you wish, and click OK to close the Set Device Name dialog box.
   * Click to reselect the device. In the Generic Client tab, toggle the Value switch on and off. You can also now enter a dimming value in the text box for the new dimming control. Hit Tab to change the value on the server. You should see the new value in the server window.

7. Offboard the server by selecting it and clicking on the offboard button.

8. Quit the client app and then press Ctrl-C in the server terminal to exit the process.

## Run on Separate Devices

Now that you’ve run a quick simulation on your own development PC and experienced the basic flow, you can get a better picture of IoTivity capabilities by running it on a Raspberry Pi board, where you can control and read its status from the same OTGC Linux application or you can download and run OTGC on an Android phone or tablet.

A workshop kit includes a Pimoroni input/output board that is used to demonstrate the capabilities of IoTivity. If you already have a Raspberry Pi board and don’t want to order the full kit, you can run a simpler demonstration.

Sample project code and instructions for kit including Raspberry Pi and a Pimoroni Explorer HAT input/output board.

## Digging deeper: Next steps for development

Now that you've created a device simulation based on IoTivity, you're read to dig deeper to explore other platforms and learn how to apply IoTivity to your own platform and devices. Use the same steps described in this tutorial, just edit the JSON input file (e.g. example.json) to include the resources on your particular device. Currently, there are examples for Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, Dragon Board and Arduino. New platforms are being added as developers contribute working examples.
