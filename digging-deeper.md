# Digging Deeper: Next Steps for Development

To learn more about developing IoT devices with IoTivity, read the following:

### [Development workflow tutorial](https://github.com/openconnectivity/IOTivity-Lite-setup/blob/master/Readme.md)
***
   **[Todo OCF: Provide a suitable destination for this "Development workflow tutorial" link. The tutorial would go beyond the simple Customize the Code exercise above. It will walk the developer through creating a new project from scratch. Is this the PowerPoint translated by OCF into a PDF or markdown?]**
***

Create a whole separate test project (create configuration file, generate device server code, build and use).

### [Development workflow reference](https://github.com/openconnectivity/IOTivity-Lite-setup/blob/master/Readme.md)

Folder structure, recommended development flow and description of core scripts.

### [Detailed programming guide](https://wiki.iotivity.org/)

From initializing the stack, through managing scenes and details in between.
